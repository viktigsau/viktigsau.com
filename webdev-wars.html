        <h1>Introducing WebDev Wars</h1>
        <h2>What is WebDev Wars?</h2>
        <p>WebDev Wars is like a game jam, but instead of making games, we make websites. We accept all kinds of websites, including games, as long as they are written in HTML, CSS, JS, TS, PHP, or any other language the web is made of. And as a bonus, it's completely free.</p>
        <h2>Where to submit code?</h2>
        <p>You can submit your code by sending an email to <a href="mailto:webdevwars@viktigsau.org">webdevwars@viktigsau.org</a> with the code. If your website is hard to understand or interpret, you may include a description or explanation.</p>
        <h2>What is the prize for the winner?</h2>
        <p>The prize for winning is that I will publish your website with your name and contact information so potential investors can see your talent.</p>
        <h2>When?</h2>
        <p>I'll be announcing the winner on the October 31st at 6 PM GMT+01:00.</p>
